# Sales-Dashboard-Project-Power-BI-# Sales Dashboard Project – Power BI 📊

Turning Raw Data into Actionable Insights with Power BI.

My latest project is a **fully interactive Sales Dashboard** built using the **Super Store dataset**. The goal of this dashboard was to deliver a **360° snapshot of business performance** so decision-makers can move from **data → insight → action** instantly.

## ✨ Key Highlights

* **KPI Cards:** Quick insights into Total Sales, Quantity, and Profit
* **YoY Trend Analysis:** Monthly performance tracking to spot seasonality
* **Category Insights:** Deep dive into performance by Segment, Ship Mode, and Region

Working on this project strengthened my understanding of **data modeling, DAX calculations, and visual hierarchy** to tell a clear story through design.
